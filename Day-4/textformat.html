<p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of<b> papers</b>. Many <i>students</i> define paragraphs in terms of length: a<b> paragraph </b>is a group of at<u> least five sentences</u>, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the <mark>unity</mark> and <mark> coherence</mark> of ideas among sentences is what <mark>constitutes</mark> a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as <tt>“a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” </tt>(Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some<b> styles of writing</b>, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just <u>one sentence long</u>. Ultimately, a paragraph is a <i>sentence or group of sentences</i> that support <mark>one main idea</mark>. In this<b> handout</b>, we will refer to this as the <pre>“controlling idea",</pre> because it controls what happens in the <b>rest of the paragraph</b>.
