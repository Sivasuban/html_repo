 <summary>Success Story</summary>
   <p><li>Suparna is from West Bengal, India. She is the eldest of three children, and today, she is a mother herself, with a 4-year-old son. She comes from a background in which female education is considered sinful, and Suparna had to overcome incredible obstacles in order to complete her formal education.</li><li>She had to face the objections of her family, and challenge repressive societal expectations, in order to create an independent identity for herself.</li><li>But she persevered, and after completing her Master’s, Suparna found a life partner who supported her goals and ambitions. In 2016 however, her son fell critically ill, and she stopped working in order to care for him. Returning to the workforce was difficult—technology moves so fast, and she didn’t know how to fit back into the job market.</li><li>But as a Google Developer Scholarship recipient, she is now engaged in an intensive learning program, and looking forward to using her new skills not just in her own life, but to uplift others in situations similar to what she’s had to overcome.</li></p>
